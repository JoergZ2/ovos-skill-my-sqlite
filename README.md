Mycroft Skill for adding records to a database using sqlite

## About
The initial goal is to develop database dialogs that allow you to enter and edit records in an SQLite database. Later the extension to create and configure arbitrary databases is planned.
Adding later (realy under construction, not working yet) 

## Examples
* "Hey Mycroft, add tool in database tools"
* "Hey Mycroft, where is the (tool) Hammer"
* "Hey Mycroft, do I have somethimg like a scriber"
